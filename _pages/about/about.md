# Hello World!
My name is Jesper Martinsson. I am an IT-Nerd, Software Developer and Lover of everything with buttons.
I am born, raised and still living in Sweden.

On this page/blog I intend to write stories and thoughts about my daily life as a professional in the IT workspace but also from my private life as an IT-nerd, Music maker and a father of two girls.

At my current day job I work as a Developer / IT-Manager for an In-house IT team at Raksystems.

On my spare time I like to hang out with my family and travel, often with our caravan and electric car (Yes thats a thing). I also play guitar in a band - I do not have any hopes of becoming a rock star, but you never know.
