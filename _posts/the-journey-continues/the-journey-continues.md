# The upgrades continues
The day started early at 04:00. After a quick cleanup and packing we went down to the hotel lobby for a small breakfast, little did we know - this would not be the last breakfast today.

After getting throug check in, bagage drop and the security controll (that all and all took about 15 minutes) we headed to the airport lounge for second breakfast.

After a quick second breakfast we went to our gate, once we got there we heard them calling out our names in the speaker, that is usually not a good sign. But to our surprise they did not tell us that we hade done something wrong or that there was some trouble of sort. No, they informed us that we had been upgraded to business class and wanted to give us our new boarding passes. Third breakfast in the sky - here we go!

After indulging in a sweet and free airplane breakfast we landed in Munich with around 2 hours to kill before our connecting flight. So what do you do with 2 hours to spare? off course we went to the airport lounge for a forth breakfast, becase at this point, why not!

# The city was suspicious to see us

Once we arrived at our destination we droped of our baggage at the hotel and went to town, only to discover that the city was pretty suspicious to see us.

Joke aside, the city of Sibiu is sometimes called the city of eyes due to the small windows on many of the buildings that makes them look like they have eyes.
