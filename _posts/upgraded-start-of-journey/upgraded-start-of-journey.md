# A Great Start
This journey to Transylvania is of to a great start. Since the plane departs so early in the morning, we decided to take a hotel night at the airport.

At check in we got informed that our room had been upgraded, nice! Room upgrades happen pretty frequently but to our surprise this was on a new level - we got the biggest suite at the whole hotel.

The room had everything you could think of and more! When did you last stay in a hotel room with a multi room audio setup, a vinyl record player and included binoculars for plane spotting.

Too bad it’s only for one night. Let’s see what happens tomorrow.
